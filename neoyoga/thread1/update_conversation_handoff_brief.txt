- **Philosophy:** Movement/expression/catharsis â†’ Stillness â†’ Traditional practice

**CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE MANAGEMENT:**
- **Minimal mention** of controversial sources to avoid deterring communities
- **Focus on THEIR interests:** Classical yoga, Zen, Vipassana, Self-inquiry, Professional stress
