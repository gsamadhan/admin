## üîß **GITHUB REPOSITORY STRATEGY**

### **Recommended Structure: Single Repository with Project Coordination**
```
strategic-framework/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (Master navigation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meditation-center/ (Project #1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ osho-rebuttal/ (Project #2)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coordination/ (Cross-project strategy)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context/ (Thread transition files)
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ **Unified Access:** Single repository link for complete framework
- ‚úÖ **Coordination Tracking:** Cross-project benefits documented
- ‚úÖ **Strategic Evolution:** Version control for integrated framework
- ‚úÖ **Team Collaboration:** One access point for consultants/staff

### **Thread Strategy: Flexible Approach**
**Recommended:** Use combined threads when possible, separate when focused work needed

**Combined Thread Benefits:**
- Cross-project coordination opportunities
- Strategic synchronization maintained
- Efficient use of message limits
- Academic shield strategy optimization

**Separate Thread Scenarios:**
- Deep academic work on Project #2 requiring focus
- Intensive implementation work on Project #1
- When one project needs extended technical development

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS (ORDER OF PRIORITY)**

### **1. Document Recreation Strategy (This Session)**
**High Priority Recreation (Choose 3-4):**
- `detailed_implementation_frameworks.md` (Project #2 - immediate implementation)
- `complete_website_strategy_guide.md` (Project #1 - deployment ready)
- `copyright_spiritual_freedom.md` (Project #2 - legal challenges ready)
- `enhanced_implementation_strategy.md` (Project #1 - three-venue ecosystem)

### **2. GitHub Repository Setup (Next 24 hours)**
- Create repository with recommended structure
- Upload recreated artifacts + existing documents
- Share repository access links
- Test workflow with one document update

### **3. Document Management Protocol (Ongoing)**
- Share GitHub file URLs for specific updates needed
- AI creates updated artifacts for copy-paste to GitHub
- Maintain version control and strategic evolution
- Use repository for thread transitions
